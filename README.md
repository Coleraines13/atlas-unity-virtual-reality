Readme for projects about VR 

About me

My name is Cole Raines and i am a software developer with a specification in Ar/Vr and these projects are all about VR and all the intricate pieces you would need to make a game in it or just an eviroment to make a simulation there is also a project about making a 360-video this readme will help you get started making things like the 360-video, physics in unity and avatar motion to follow your headset and controllers.

Prerequisites

Basic understanding of unity3D.

Familiarity with VR development using platforms like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or similar.

Knowledge of C# programming language.

Setting Up 360-Video

1. Import 360-Video: Import your 360-degree video asset into Unity.

2. Video Player Setup: Use Unity's Video Player component to display the video.

3. 360-Video Rendering: Apply a 360-degree video shader to ensure proper rendering.

4. Interactivity: Implement user interaction with the video, such as play, pause, and seek functionalities.


Accessibility features

1. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Integrate TTS functionality to provide audio descriptions of the VR environment and interactions for visually impaired users.

2. Color Contrast: Ensure sufficient color contrast for UI elements to aid users with color vision deficiencies.

3. Controller Vibration Feedback: Implement controller vibration feedback for better interaction feedback, aiding users with hearing impairments.

Avatar motion and interaction 

1. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Integrate TTS functionality using Unity's Text-to-Speech API or third-party plugins to provide audio descriptions of the VR environment and interactions.

2. Color Contrast: Ensure sufficient color contrast for UI elements by using high-contrast color schemes and avoiding color combinations that may be difficult to distinguish for users with color vision deficiencies.

3. Controller Vibration Feedback: Implement controller vibration feedback for better interaction feedback, especially useful for users with hearing impairments. Utilize Unity's Input System to detect user inputs and trigger controller vibrations accordingly.


Physics implementation 

1. Rigidbody Dynamics: Utilize Unity's Rigidbody component to simulate physics interactions within the VR environment. Attach Rigidbody components to interactive objects that require physics simulations.

2. Collision Detection: Implement collision detection using Unity's Collider components to detect interactions between virtual objects and the VR user or other objects within the scene.

3. Force and Torque: Apply forces and torques to objects based on user interactions to create realistic physics simulations. Use Unity's physics API to apply forces dynamically based on user actions, such as grabbing and throwing objects.
